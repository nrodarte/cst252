		<div id="paragraph">
		<p> Hello, my name is Nick Rodarte and this is my CST252 homepage. I am a 23 year old communication design student from San Jose, Ca and this is my second semester at the school.
		My hobbies include video games, cooking, art and listening to music from around the world. I spend most of my free time playing games with my friends, drawing tattoos/cartoons/graffiti or calligraphy and I like to mess around cooking in the kitchen.
	To see my artwork please visit my instagram page @nick.rodarte. Thank you ! </p>
