// Understand the Problem
   //Creating a Hangman game with 2 players.
   //Play1 will decide the word for game and Play2 will guess
   //the letters to fill in the  word.
   //Guesser will only have 6 tries to guess word
   //Each players will take turns doing each role after each loss/win

   // create board
// set word from Play1
//play 2 guesses letters
//check if letter is a part of word
//if yes than fill in a blank, if no take a life from Play2
// check for win/loss
// switch sides if win or loss


//GAME SET UP
//show board
// play1 set word
// board matches length of word
//play2 turn: guess a letter
// if yes: fill in blank
// if no: take a life from play2
//repeat until word is filled in or play2 submits 6 wrong guesses
// swap sides after win/loss

//Assinging objects
//set up game object:Hangman
//set up board object:Board
//assign player1 obect: Player1
//assign guesser object: Player2

//start loop described
//set word from Play1
//play 2 guesses letters
//check if letter is a part of word
//if yes than fill in a blank, if no take a life from Play2
// check for win/loss
// switch sides if win or loss


//Js psuedocode

//call object board
//ask play1 to set word
//ask play2 to begin guessing
//if guesser is right: add letter to Board
//if guesser is wrong: take a life (draw a part of the hangingman)
//loop until 6 wrong guesses or word is fully filled
// swap play1 and Play2
