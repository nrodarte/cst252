		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1> This lab challenged us to use JSON and APIs to pull data for it to be displayed on our webpage.</p1>

	</div>

	<div id="prob">

		<h2> Problems </h2>

		<p2> We ran into errors with the XML request and CORS, we solved this through checking our page from the server view and our problems were locally based. Our page was not allowed to pull the data for it to be displayed locally but it was working on the server the whole time.

</p2>

	</div>

	<div id="result">

		<h3> Results </h3>

		<p3> As a result of our work, we targeted certain data from the JSON object hosted on the API and we have that data displayed in our output div. There are two buttons that will cycle the title of the comic and the image that houses the comics. </p3>
