		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1> Lab 8 tasked us to experiment with functions and call backs. We created an array and a function in chrome that would find display the squareroot of each number in the array. We copied it over to atom and linked the .js file to our html page.
		When inspecting the page on chrome, you can see our fucntions output, check it out! </p1>

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> We ran into one single syntax error in our whole lab creation process, everything ran really smoothly and we really attribute this to the screenshots provided by wes on the assignment. </p2>
