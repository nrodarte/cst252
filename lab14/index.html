		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1> We were taksed to create a constructor called Vhicle to take in information (make, model, year, name, and extras) and return a string with said information. We were to instantiate objects using the constructor to list every vehicle we have ever owned.

		<h2> Problems </h2>

		<p2>
			We ran into one issue that took us a good 5 minutes to solve, we could not get our name property to output. We solved this by noticing that our functions parameters did not include the name, therefore it was ignoring it. After adding this it still did not appear but it was a simple mistake of leaving out a semicolon that held us back at this point.
			Other than this one issue we ran into, everything went smoothly.
