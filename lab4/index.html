		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1>In this lab the challenges we had were understanding the  pseudocode. To help ourselves we went
		into W3Schhols to look up terms we never used before. The term "Pre" was one thing we were stuck on
		for about like 10 minutes. After about 10 minutes we were able to get started on the lab with no problems at all.</p1>

		<h2> Problems </h2>

		<p2>In this lab the problems we faced were really nothing except for getting familiar with the term "Pre". Other than that
		it was smooth sailing. </p2>

		<h3> Results </h3>

		<p3>The results of this lab were great. everything was done perfectly on time without any bug issues.
			We were also both able to add this lab to our class webpages. After that uploading to the serves worked perfectly.
			It allowed us to see our work not only locally but also on the server. Below we have included our two outlines in their own organized section.   </p3>

	<pre> How to Cook traditional  Spagehtti Aglio e Olio: 15 minutes, 6 ingriendients
	1. To cook traditional Aglio e Olio (oil and garlic) you only need to gather a few things
	  gather the following ingriendients: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Garlic, Dried or Fresh Spagehtti, Salt, and Italian Parsely, dried red chili flakes.
	    optionally: pecorino romano/ parmagianno regianno cheeses, teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, black pepper
	      gather the following items: pot for boiling water, a decent sized pan, tongs, knife and cutting board for chopping

	2. Once everything is gathered you can begin the cooking process by:
	  filling the pot with enough water to cover the Spagehtti
	    add at least 3 tablespoons of salt to water and then bring to a boil
	    while water is boiling, turn pan on low heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan

	3. Chop Garlic and parsley
	  cut the garlic into thin slices, no need to mince, chop or mash
	    chop parsley roughly, no need to be precise on how much you use, a nice handful will work
	      set aside

	4. When water finally boils add pasta and stir occasionlly to prevent sticking

	5. After pasta is in, start the sauce
	  add garlic to pan, add enough chili flakes to suit your taste and turn up heat from low to medium low
	    small bubbles should be seen around the garlic, keep the heat low so these stay present but dont grow
	      stir occasionlly

	6. 8-12 minutes to cook Spagehtti,
	  after 6 minutes fish a noodle out with tongs and take a bite or break with hands to check doneness
	    repeat process every minute or so to ensure its done

	7. when pasta is finished, fish out from pot using tongs and add directly to pan
	    cut the heat
	      do this so the pasta is still wet, adding pasta water to the sauce in the process
	          water will stop the pasta from frying, prevent to garlic from overcooking and add body to sauce (starchy water).


	8. Stir to combine
	  top with parsley and drizzle of olive oil
	    this is the step in where you would add the optional ingriendients: squeeze of lemon, pinch of pepper, grated cheese on top

	9. Serve

	  	show black screen with playbutton icon centered
	    		when clicked: start step 2

Step2: Rectanlge appears from left of screen
	       animation of rectangle going to center of screen
	          When rectangle hovered, play button reappears
	            when play button clicked: start step 3

Step3: Play button (vector graphic acting as hyperlink) when clicked:
		video player appears in rectangle
			after 3 seconds: start introduction to site Video
					after video ends start step 4

Step4: video player disappears
