//How to Cook traditional  Spagehtti Aglio e Olio: 15 minutes, 6 ingriendients
//1. To cook traditional Aglio e Olio (oil and garlic) you only need to gather a few things
  //gather the following ingriendients: Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Garlic, Dried or Fresh Spagehtti, Salt, and Italian Parsely, dried red chili flakes.
    //optionally: pecorino romano/ parmagianno regianno cheeses, teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, black pepper
      //gather the following items: pot for boiling water, a decent sized pan, tongs, knife and cutting board for chopping

//2. Once everything is gathered you can begin the cooking process by:
  //filling the pot with enough water to cover the Spagehtti
    //add at least 3 tablespoons of salt to water and then bring to a boil
    //while water is boiling, turn pan on low heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan

//3. Chop Garlic and parsley
  //cut the garlic into thin slices, no need to mince, chop or mash
    //chop parsley roughly, no need to be precise on how much you use, a nice handful will work
      //set aside

//4. When water finally boils add pasta and stir occasionlly to prevent sticking

//5. After pasta is in, start the sauce
  //add garlic to pan, add enough chili flakes to suit your taste and turn up heat from low to medium low
    //small bubbles should be seen around the garlic, keep the heat low so these stay present but dont grow
      //stir occasionlly

//6. 8-12 minutes to cook Spagehtti,
  //after 6 minutes fish a noodle out with tongs and take a bite or break with hands to check doneness
    //repeat process every minute or so to ensure its done

//7. when pasta is finished, fish out from pot using tongs and add directly to pan
    //cut the heat
      //do this so the pasta is still wet, adding pasta water to the sauce in the process
          //water will stop the pasta from frying, prevent to garlic from overcooking and add body to sauce (starchy water).


//8 Stir to combine
  //top with parsley and drizzle of olive oil
    //this is the step in where you would add the optional ingriendients: squeeze of lemon, pinch of pepper, grated cheese on top

//9 Serve
