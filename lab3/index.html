		<h1> Challenges</h1>

		<p1> Lab 3 challenged us to create two html pages. We had to work together to document our file structure, created a homepage and finally create this page to write about the process.
		We had to take screenshots along the way and style both pages. </p1>

	</div>

	<div id="prob">

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> We ran into no problems this lab because the file structure was given to us and it was easy to copy to our machines following the instructions given.
			Creating our pages was also straightforward because we went with really elementary layouts and simple stylesheets.
		As a whole this lab went really smooth. </p2>

		<h3> Results </h3>

		<p3> As a result we had an organized file structure, two pages and a bunch of screenshots documenting our process step by step.
			Both of our sites were made to be very simple and clean and we were both happy with how they came out. </p3>
