		<h1> Challenges</h1>

		<p1> Lab 5 had us complete a few short tasks and document the process, this lab revolved around our introduction to java scripts lecture from earlier in the week and had us create a short program to find the age of our cars.
		We went into chrome, defined some varaibales to be used in a simple equation and we finally got our answer. We took a screenshot, moved the information to a .js file in atom. Linked the file by using the script tag and then we structured a quick html site.  </p1>
