		<h4> Lab 5: File Structure and File Transfer </h4>

		<h1> Challenges</h1>

		<p1> Lab 5 had us complete a few short tasks and document the process, this lab revolved around our introduction to java scripts lecture from earlier in the week and had us create a short program to find the age of our cars.
		We went into chrome and defined some varaibales to be used in a simple equation. We took a screenshot, moved the information to a .js file in atom and linked the file by using the script tag. Finally we structured a quick html site to hold our short summary and the result of our script.

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> This lab was really straightforward because we ran through this exercise during the lecture.
			We did every task without any isssues really, we attribute this to the lecture being a good guide and we used a previous site layout for our html/css to streamline the process. </p2>
