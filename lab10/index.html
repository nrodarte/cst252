		<h5> Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms </h5>

	</div>

	<div id="chall">

		<h1> Challenges </h1>

		<p1> We tasked to create a form that would take the users name to then shuffle and output the result using a javascript function </p1>

	</div>

	<div id="prob">

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> We ran into issues regarding our javascript, we were confused by the labs instructions and couldnt figure out how to do task 2. We studied wes' code as well as consulted some peers on how to do it.
		We used the code we looked at as reference to finally get the script to work but even when we succeeded, we were still quite confused. We have it working on the page but will have to ask questions about the process so that we can better grasp it.  </p2>

	</div>

	<div id="result">

		<h3> Results </h3>

		<p3> At the bottom of our page you can find the form, the button that runs the function and the output will appear in the div below the button. Below that we have our js source file as well as a link to our homepage.
		As a result we have a page with a form that takes user input and shuffles the characthers, outputting a new "name" below our button. </p3>

</div>

<div id="outputs">
              <input type="text" id="user-name"> Input Your Name <br>
              <button id="my-button"> Submit Here </button>
              <div id="output"></div>
